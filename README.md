# BiDirectional-Vehicle-Detection-and-Counter-YOLOv8

This project utilizes the YOLOv8 pre-trained model to detect and count vehicles moving on a highway in two directions. By providing accurate vehicle data, this project enables a range of applications in traffic management, infrastructure design, and safety enhancement.

Applications:

Transportation Engineering:
Optimizing traffic flow on highways.
Improving highway designs for better vehicle capacity and safety.

Urban Planning:
Assisting in the design of smart road infrastructure.
Planning and implementing advanced traffic control systems.

Environmental Monitoring:
Estimating vehicle emissions based on traffic density.
Supporting policies for reducing environmental impact.

By capturing and analyzing vehicle data, this project serves as a valuable tool for building smarter, more efficient transportation systems and urban infrastructure.
